Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.

John Baez has done the marketing. 

I'm a late entrant and a shit mathematician so far, which means all I can hope to do is undercut prices, i.e. reduce cognitive load.

I'll do this with cartoon drawings and cartoon words. And pointing out explictly what's sorta-derivable, what you could have invented, vs what's magical, don't bother rn.

So go read _PTLC: A Rosetta Stone_ or something so you can appreciate the massive discount I'm giving you.





Misc:
So why does an arrow $$\to X$$ mean it's close to X? It doesn't. Close can mean whatever you want it to, baby. Remember, your choice of morphisms in the category determine the structure ...baby.

I have objects dangling around now, but which one is closest? Well let's clean up things a bit.
We already told everybody about the first two rules, we don't have to tell them again, right? 
So let's get rid of all the identity arrows and the ones that could have come from composition: {obvious}


Now it's easy to see that your X ain't no slut, despite appearances.



Notice that the Homset isomoprhism is a useful definition. {not obvious}


Here's a fuck-color-consistency version in the style of Kalid, to help unpack the quantifiers in the defintion:
$$\forall X \exists Y$$


{fix, not clear at all, talking to myself}:
Later on: if you want more of the defintition, we'll introduce the fact that every "close" map factors through the counit. That is, what good is the object? Only to talk about arrows to and from, right? If we restric to arrows to X, guess what - you only need remember the counit arrow forever, and then to get arrows to X, you just compose with the counit.
The subtle thing (so subtle, I didn't even write it there) is that I can talk about arrows from FA \to X (and now, FA \to FGX) only through arrows A \to GX. That is, the structure of it really comes from the first category. That's the homset correspondence as well. This is sort of the morphism inverse part of it: if I want to "invert" morphisms from F \to X, I go GX, check for preimage, then go F on that morphism, and counit compose it. That's the corresponding "inverse".

Why would we want to look at such weird one-sided inverses? Sure I could make you go induct on it ("adjoints arise everywhere", but can I make you want it, kinda-sorta? 


{notes, remove}:
- {obvious} tags to be replaced with structure and images, so it composes almost formally and with completeness, not sprinkled on
- don't let this be The voice, only a voice)
